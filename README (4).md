# TASK 7: Get Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
# ELEVATE LABS Data Analytics Internship | Date 03 July , 2025 | Author Sarvesh Kumar

## ✅ Objectives
### 1- To connect and interact with an SQLite database using Python.

Demonstrate how to load a local .db file and execute SQL queries from within a Python script or Jupyter notebook.

### 2-To extract key sales insights such as total quantity sold and total revenue.

Use SQL aggregation (SUM, GROUP BY) to summarize product-wise sales performance.

### 3-To visualize sales performance using basic charts.

Create bar, line, and pie charts with matplotlib for clearer understanding of sales trends and product contribution.

### 4-To practice integrating SQL, pandas, and matplotlib in a single workflow.

Showcase how Python can bridge data storage (SQLite), analysis (pandas), and visualization (matplotlib) seamlessly.

### 5-To enhance data-driven decision-making based on visual and tabular summaries.

Identify top-selling products and revenue-driving items to inform business strategy.

## ✅ Outcomes
### 1-Successfully connected to an SQLite database using Python.

Demonstrated how to load a .db file and execute SQL queries with sqlite3.

### 2-Extracted key sales metrics from the database.

Generated a summary showing total quantity sold and total revenue for each product using SQL and pandas.

### 3-Printed and interpreted tabular sales summary.

Displayed clear and readable output with product-wise data using print() and DataFrame.

### 4-Created multiple data visualizations using matplotlib.

Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were used to present:

Revenue per product

Quantity sold per product

Daily revenue trends

Revenue share per product

### 5-Gained practical experience with end-to-end data analysis.

Learned how to extract, analyze, and visualize data using Python tools.

### 6-Identified top-performing products and sales trends.

Observed how high-priced items contribute more to revenue even with fewer sales, while accessories sell in high volume.
